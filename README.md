## MCU-Based Soil Scanner with Machine Learning Application for Finding Locations Suitable for Planting Narra Trees

The MCU-Based Soil Scanner with Machine Learning Application is a system designed to aid conservation groups and community reforestation programs in identifying optimal locations for planting Narra trees (Pterocarpus indicus). Given the ecological significance of Narra trees and the challenges in their growth due to soil unsuitability and deforestation, this project integrates soil scanning technology and artificial intelligence to analyze soil properties and determine areas most suitable for planting.

The system consists of multiple soil sensors (including pH, moisture, and temperature sensors) connected to a microcontroller unit (MCU), which processes the collected data. Using a machine learning model, the system classifies soil quality based on key parameters necessary for Narra tree growth. A user interface (mobile/web app) presents the analyzed data in a user-friendly format, allowing stakeholders to make informed decisions.

The project aims to provide an affordable and accessible solution for sustainable reforestation, reducing the trial-and-error method in tree planting. The developers conducted research through literature reviews, database and prototype trial, and soil sampling to refine the system's efficiency. Before deployment, the system undergoes multiple tests and validation procedures to ensure accuracy in soil assessment. The results will contribute to future reforestation efforts and environmental conservation strategies.
